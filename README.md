This is a WebGL based "coloring book" app, which I wrote for a school internship.\
Credit for the GUI icons goes to Rodney.

This application is fully CPU based, as I could not get shader-based drawing to play nicely with\
WebGL. This means that no shaders are involved other than basic Unity shaders, and it entirely uses\
non-shader code. This should work at 45+ FPS on mid to low spec systems, which is about as good as I\
could get it for tools like the highlighter, which are very math heavy.

Any WebGL browser should support this, and a hosting can be found here: https://nnaapp.github.io/iCube-Coloring-Book/

I don't intend to work on this more, but I am happy to answer questions if anyone ever has them.
